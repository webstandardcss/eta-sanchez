    <h1>Firm Overview</h1>
    <p>Recognized as a Leader in the Community</p>
    <p>I grew up in Longview and I am committed to giving back to the community where I spent my youth. After practicing law at some other law firms, I decided to move back and open Jose Sanchez Law Firm, P.C., in 2005. Since that time, I have become a leader
      in the community as evidenced through radio, TV interviews, and newspaper articles. For more information, visit my

    <p>Firsthand Knowledge</p>
    <p>I have made a name for myself as a resource for immigrants because I have gone through the
      <a href="Immigration-13.php">
        <strong>immigration</strong>
      </a> process as an immigrant myself. I know how the process works.</p>
    <p>I understand that obtaining a green card or obtaining citizenship can seem difficult. I will explain eligibility requirements for naturalization and take the time to talk with you about your concerns. I speak Spanish, so non-English speakers can feel
      confident there will not be problems with a language barrier.</p>
    <p>A Full-Service Firm</p>
    <p>In addition to immigration law, our legal practice includes
      <a href="Personal-Injury.php">
        <strong>personal injury</a>, <a href="Civil-Litigation.php">civil litigation</strong></a> and
      <a href="Criminal-Defense.php">
        <strong>criminal law</strong>
      </a> to provide you with a range of services to meet your needs. We can use our knowledge across these areas to develop a strong strategy for your case. </p>
    <p>We are not afraid to go against the norm, and we will do whatever it takes for our clients. We have led marches with immigrants in the pursuit of justice. For more information, visit the
