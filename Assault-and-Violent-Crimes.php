    <h1>Assault and Violent Crimes</h1>
    <p>Assault and domestic violence charges can carry serious penalties. What began as an argument could lead to jail time and the loss of your parental rights. If you are not a U.S. citizen, an assault case could result in denial of citizenship or deportation.
